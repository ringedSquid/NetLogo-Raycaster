<h1>Simple Textured Netlogo Raycaster</h1>
<h2>Final project for Stuyvesant IntroCS semester 1</h2>
<br>
<h3>A message...</h3>
<p>
People within the Stuyvesant often view netlogo in a negative light, disliking it's strangeness or what they perceive to be it's lack of capability.
While netlogo is indeed quite limited, it is still quite capable. In fact I beleive that anyone can make anything they dream of in netlogo (to a certain extent)
Making this raycaster was fun, not only because of the fact that I was trying to use netlogo in such an unconventional way, but also because I figured out all the maths and cool algorithms on my own time, learning them for myself instead of simple copying some guide. I built an intuition, and didn't blindly memorize or copy the code.

<h3>How to run</h3>
<p>Netlogo version required: 6.3.0 or higher. <br>
<p>Make sure to set the tick speed to max and set view updates to "on ticks". <br>
<p>Press the setup button to initialize the raycaster. <br>
When you're ready press play to start it! <br>
The movement buttons are mapped to the keyboard: <br>
    w -> forward <br>
    s -> backward <br>
    a -> turn left <br>
    d -> turn right <br>
make sure your cursor is outside the rendering window for the keymaps to work properly. <br>
Your goal is to navigate the maze and look for the exit while avoiding the main enemy of the game: greg the cube. <br>
Greg's program is very basic and doesn't work half the time, this was due to time constraints on this project. <br>
Have fun!!! <br>
