# Netlogo-Raycaster

Final project for Stuyvesant IntroCS semester 1



## A Message...
People within the Stuyvesant often view netlogo in a negative light, disliking it's strangeness or what they perceive to be it's lack of capability. While netlogo is indeed quite limited, it is still quite capable. In fact I beleive that anyone can make anything they dream of in netlogo (to a certain extent) Making this raycaster was fun, not only because of the fact that I was trying to use netlogo in such an unconventional way, but also because I figured out all the maths and cool algorithms on my own time, learning them for myself instead of simple copying some guide. I built an intuition, and didn't blindly memorize or copy the code.
